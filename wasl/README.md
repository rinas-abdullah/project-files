# وَصل | WASL

**AI-powered logistics digital twin & decision intelligence for truck reception** — a Naqlthon 5 prototype.

> «وجود موعد مؤكد للشاحنة لا يعني بالضرورة أن المنشأة جاهزة لاستقبالها»
> A confirmed appointment does not mean the facility is ready to receive the truck.

WASL links truck arrivals to the facility's real capacity to serve them, through one decision loop:

**Predict → Optimize → Simulate → Verify → Release → Learn**

| Step | What actually runs |
|---|---|
| Predict | scikit-learn service-time regressor and congestion-risk classifier, trained on a *declared* synthetic process, evaluated against baselines ([`services/intelligence/wasl_intel/ml.py`](services/intelligence/wasl_intel/ml.py)) |
| Optimize | Google OR-Tools CP-SAT: dock, crew and start-time assignment under compatibility, no-overlap, shift, equipment, inspector and yard constraints ([`optimizer.py`](services/intelligence/wasl_intel/optimizer.py)) |
| Simulate | SimPy discrete-event model comparing FCFS, fixed appointments, OR-only and full WASL, with seeds, versions and event logs stored ([`simulation.py`](services/intelligence/wasl_intel/simulation.py)) |
| Verify | Server-side Readiness-to-Release engine: 13 checks with evidence, policy-based overrides ([`engine.ts`](apps/api/src/domain/readiness/engine.ts)) |
| Release | Atomic reservation of dock + crew + equipment in one transaction; a Postgres `EXCLUDE` constraint makes double booking impossible ([`service.ts`](apps/api/src/domain/readiness/service.ts), [`0001_integrity.sql`](apps/api/drizzle/0001_integrity.sql)) |
| Learn | Actual vs. estimated service times are recorded and reported; retraining on real data is **not implemented** (no real data exists) |

Everything runs on **synthetic data**. Sensors are **100% virtual**. No real warehouse is connected.

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
cd wasl
docker compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

## Local development

Requirements: Node ≥ 20, Python ≥ 3.11, PostgreSQL 16.

```bash
cd wasl && npm install
pip install -r services/intelligence/requirements-dev.txt
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env            # set DATABASE_URL / DEMO_PASSWORD
(cd services/intelligence && python -m wasl_intel.train && uvicorn wasl_intel.app:app --port 8000)
npm run db:migrate && npm run db:seed
npm run dev:api        # http://localhost:4000  (OpenAPI UI at /api/docs)
npm run dev:web        # http://localhost:3000
